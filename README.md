# Final Project

## Deliverable 1

### Communication Protocols

Multiple modes of communication and protocols have been established for Team Yelp:
- A "final_project" Slack channel has been created for general text communication and content-sharing (this is currently the primary mode of communication)
- Phone numbers and emails have been exchanged via a shared Google Sheet as alternate modes of communication in case a team member cannot be reached via Slack
- A shared Google Drive folder has been created for planning and outlining project goals, objectives and tasks
- A Zoom account has been established for team meetings
- Team meetings will be held at least once a week with flexible scheduling in order to accomodate workload and personal schedules
