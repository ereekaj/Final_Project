# Denver Businesses and PPP Loan Repayment Risk

## Deliverable 1

### Selected topic
Denver Businesses and PPP Loan Repayment Risk

### Reason why we selected their topic 
Businesses were hit hard during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many industries suffered significant sales and job losses since the pandemic began. We chose to explore how businesses used Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and whether loan repayment can be predicted using Machine Learning. Our whole team lives in Denver, CO so we chose to focus solely on businesses in the Denver metro area. 

### Description of our source of data
We have chosen to explore Denver business data from the Yelp Fusion API and loan data from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) managed by the Small Business Administration.
Sources:
*  [Yelp Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started)
*  [PPP Data](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program/ppp-data) 

### Questions we hope to answer with the data
* Can restaurant data and PPP loan data reasonably predict whether a loan will be paid in full or not?

* Do factors like the type of businesses, location, gender of lendee, size of loan or other factors affect loan repayment?

* Were certain types of businesses able to pay loans back in full while others weren't? 

### Communication Protocols

Multiple modes of communication and protocols have been established for Team Yelp:
- A "final_project" Slack channel has been created for general text communication and content-sharing (this is currently the primary mode of communication)

- Phone numbers and emails have been exchanged via a shared Google Sheet as alternate modes of communication in case a team member cannot be reached via Slack

- A shared Google Drive folder has been created for planning and outlining project goals, objectives and tasks

- A Zoom account has been established for team meetings outside of class

- Team meetings will be held at least once a week with flexible scheduling in order to accomodate workload and personal schedules
