# Final Project

## Deliverable 1: Communication Protocols

Multiple modes of communication and protocols have been established for Team Yelp:
- A "final_project" Slack channel has been created for general text communication and content-sharing (this is currently the primary mode of communication)
- Phone numbers and emails have been exchanged via a shared Google Sheet as alternate modes of communication in case a team member cannot be reached via Slack
- A shared Google Drive folder has been created for planning and outlining project goals and objectives
- A Zoom account will be established for team meetings (Discord might be utilized for this instead)
- Team meetings will be held on a twice-weekly basis to collaborate and ensure all project requirements are being fulfilled on time (final schedule TBD)
