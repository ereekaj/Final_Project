# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We will be using Pandas and Python in Jupyter notebook to do the data cleanup and analysis.

## Database Storage
Mongo and Flask would be ideal for the hosted site, however we may go a different direction depending on how we display the data.

## Machine Learning
a number machine learning models were run to determine the best model. The best model was determined to be random forest classifier due to its high accuracy at 90.4% and out of all the models that were run it had the highest precision at 33%. 

## Dashboard
We will be using Tableau to visualize our data. We have various interactive elements on our Tableau dashboard including a map of businesses and various plots showing size of loan, types of businesses and other features.  Users are able to change views and hover over data points to get additional information from the map and plots.
