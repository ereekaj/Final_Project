# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We will be using Pandas and Python in Jupyter notebook to do the data cleanup and analysis.

## Database Storage
Mongo and Flask would be ideal for the hosted site, however we may go a different direction depending on how we display the data.

## Machine Learning
We have not decided on a ML algorithm yet. 

## Dashboard
We are deciding between hosting the graphs on tableu public, or hosting a page on github similar to the bellybutton biodiversity project. That would include interactive dropdowns possibly incorperating maps with layers.
